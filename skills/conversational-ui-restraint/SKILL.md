description: >-
  Build or review a chat/copilot/assistant interface — message list, composer,
  streaming responses, conversation sidebar, canvas/side-panel for structured
  output. Trigger for "make this chat UI look like ChatGPT/Claude", "为什么我的
  对话界面看起来很乱", "streaming response feels janky", "conversation sidebar
  needs work", "this looks AI-generated", or when reviewing a chat/assistant
  screen before shipping it. This is a DIFFERENT problem than dense dashboards
  — a chat UI's job is to get out of the way of the content, not to show more
  data per screen (use `terminal-software-design` for tables/dashboards/data
  grids, not this). Do NOT trigger to invent a generic app aesthetic from a
  blank slate (use `ui-ux-pro-max`) or for landing pages. Portable:
  self-contained prose, no script dependency — works pasted into any assistant.

# Conversational UI Restraint

The best chat/assistant interfaces (ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Codex) don't look good
because of a secret tool — they look good because of a small set of disciplines
applied consistently, all pointing the same direction: **the interface should
disappear and the content should be the only thing anyone remembers.** This is
the opposite instinct from `terminal-software-design`, where density is
correct — here, restraint is correct, because the "data" is prose, and prose
needs room to be read, not scanned.

A naive attempt at "make it look like ChatGPT" tends to copy the surface (a
gray sidebar, rounded message bubbles) and miss the actual discipline
underneath: near-monochrome color reserved for signal, content-first visual
hierarchy, one consistent icon language, motion that serves comprehension
rather than decorates it.

## 1. Color: monochrome first, color is a signal not a decoration

- Default to a near-monochrome palette (grays/whites/near-blacks) for the
  interface chrome itself. Reserve actual color for things that mean
  something: a link, a syntax-highlighted token, a status indicator, the
  one brand accent used sparingly (a send button, a selected state).
- If everything has a little color — every icon tinted, every card with an
  accent border — nothing stands out, and the page reads as decorated
  rather than considered. The restraint itself is the signal of quality.
- Dark and light mode both need this discipline independently — a dark
  theme with the same near-monochrome restraint reads calm; a dark theme
  where every element got a random accent color to "pop" reads busy.

## 2. Content is the star; chrome recedes

- Message content gets the most visual weight: best contrast, most
  generous line-height, comfortable measure (~60-75 characters per line
  for prose). UI chrome (timestamps, avatars, action icons) should be
  quieter — smaller, lower contrast, revealed on hover rather than always
  fighting for attention.
- Don't let structural UI (borders around every message, heavy card
  shadows per bubble) compete with the text. A hairline separator or
  whitespace alone is usually enough to distinguish turns — test removing
  the border before adding one.
- Code blocks, tables, and structured data inside a conversation should
  look distinctly different from prose (monospace, a subtle background
  tint) so the eye can tell at a glance which register it's reading in.

## 3. One icon language, used sparingly

- Pick one icon set (consistent stroke width, consistent corner radius)
  and never mix in a second family — a rounded-corner icon next to a
  sharp-corner one from a different set is one of the fastest tells that
  a UI wasn't considered as a whole.
- Most actions in a chat UI don't need an icon at all — text labels are
  often clearer than an icon for anything beyond the handful of universal
  ones (send, attach, copy, more). Icon-only buttons need a tooltip or
  they're a guessing game.

## 4. Motion serves comprehension, not decoration

- Streaming text should feel like the model is *thinking and writing*, not
  like text is being typewriter-animated for effect — token-by-token
  reveal with no extra easing/bounce on top of it.
- Loading states (thinking, searching, running a tool) should show
  *what's actually happening* when possible ("Searching the web…",
  "Reading 3 files…") rather than a generic spinner — this is honesty as
  much as it is craft; don't imply progress on work that isn't happening.
- Avoid animating things that don't need it: a new message appearing
  doesn't need a slide-and-fade entrance, it needs to just be there. Motion
  budget is scarce — spend it on the one or two moments that actually
  benefit (a response starting to stream, a tool call resolving), not
  scattered across every state change.

## 5. Progressive disclosure: keep the conversation clean

- When output has real structure (a document, a code diff, a generated
  image, a chart), don't force it into the linear message stream — surface
  it in a side panel/canvas that opens next to the conversation, so the
  chat itself stays a clean record of the exchange rather than a scroll of
  giant embedded artifacts.
- The side panel itself should follow `terminal-software-design`'s density
  rules once it's showing structured content (a document, a diff, a
  table) — the conversational restraint above applies to the chat pane,
  not to every panel in the app.
- Conversation sidebar (history list): compact rows, no per-item card
  chrome — a hover state and the title/date is usually enough. This is a
  list to scan and pick from, not content to read, so it can be denser
  than the message pane itself.

## 6. Empty and onboarding states

- A first-run empty state should suggest the next concrete action in the
  product's own vocabulary (a few example prompts specific to what the
  tool actually does), not a generic "How can I help you today?" with no
  grounding in the product.
- Don't over-decorate the empty state to compensate for having nothing to
  show yet — a centered greeting plus a few real example actions is
  usually enough; a large illustration or animation here reads as filling
  space rather than being helpful.

## 7. Coding-agent-specific conventions (Codex-style)

If the conversation involves code/file changes rather than pure prose:

- Diffs use the standard +/- color convention (additions/removals), never
  a novel scheme — this is the one place where inventing your own visual
  language actively hurts comprehension.
- File paths render as breadcrumbs or truncated-with-tooltip, never
  wrapped mid-path.
- Long tool output (command results, file listings) collapses by default
  with an explicit expand — showing everything inline turns the
  conversation into a wall of logs.
- Task/step status (running, done, failed) needs a consistent glyph +
  color pairing used identically everywhere it appears, not styled
  per-context.

## Checklist

- [ ] Is color reserved for signal (links, status, one accent), not
      scattered as decoration across icons/cards?
- [ ] Does message content have visibly more weight than the chrome around
      it (timestamps, avatars, hover-only actions)?
- [ ] Is there exactly one icon family in use, with text labels where an
      icon alone would be ambiguous?
- [ ] Does streaming/loading motion communicate real state, not just move
      for its own sake?
- [ ] Does structured output (documents, diffs, tables) open in a side
      panel instead of bloating the message stream?
- [ ] Is the empty state grounded in this product's actual capabilities,
      not a generic greeting?
- [ ] (Coding-agent UIs) Do diffs use standard +/- color, and does long
      tool output collapse by default?
